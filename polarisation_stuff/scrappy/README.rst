Scrappy is a tool used to generate Faraday spectra for various indpeendent lines of sight across an extragalactic source. It began as a custom script for Pictor A field, but is now able to support any field provided a source mask is given.

This package consists of five scripts

- `sc-los`: To generate the independent sc-los
- `sc-los-rm`: Perform RM-synthesis + RM-CLEAN on the LoS generated by `sc-los`
- `sc-rmmap`: Generate among other things, an RM map
- `sc-bokehplot`: Generate interactive plots for the LoS. These are for integration with `PolarVis`
- `sc-ifit`: A rudimentary script for fitting taylor polynomials to Stokes I

Each of the scripts has a help text that is accessible via the `-h` flag. Please consult that for more information on the parameters required to ran the individual scripts.
